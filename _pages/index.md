# Welcome to My Home


Hi!, I’m Stephen Akuoko. I am a Research and Teaching Assistant at the [University of Mines and Technology](https://umat.edu.gh/) (UMaT), where my work focuses on data science and machine learning applications in chemical and energy systems.

I recently completed a summer internship with [Envirofit International](https://envirofit.org/), a global R&D leader in clean cooking technologies designed to cook faster while reducing fuel use, smoke, and toxic emissions. At Envirofit, I contributed to projects aimed at improving efficiency, reducing waste, and scaling up production processes.

Before joining UMaT, I earned my Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Petrochemical Engineering from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://chemeng.knust.edu.gh/) (KNUST). For my final-year thesis, under the guidance of Dr. Emmanuel Godwin Ankudey, I worked on the “Plant Design for the Production of Ammonia from Isopentane,” where I developed process simulations using Aspen PLUS and carried out economic analyses in Excel.

Beyond research, I enjoy watching football with friends, biking, and listening to music.
