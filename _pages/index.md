Welcome to my personal website! Here you can find a bit about my research, the projects I contributed to, and my academic and non-academic life. I’m Stephen Akuoko, a Research and Teaching Assistant at the [University of Mines and Technology](https://umat.edu.gh/) (UMaT), where my work focuses on data science and machine learning applications in chemical and energy systems.

I recently completed a summer internship with [Envirofit International](https://envirofit.org/), a global R&D leader in clean cooking technologies designed to cook faster while reducing fuel use, smoke, and toxic emissions. At Envirofit, I contributed to projects aimed at improving efficiency, reducing waste, and scaling up production processes.

Before joining UMaT, I earned my Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Petrochemical Engineering from the [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://chemeng.knust.edu.gh/) (KNUST) where I collaborated with a team of Petrochemical Engineering students as part of my final year design project as we investigated how Ammonia can be synthesised from Isopentane, an industrial waste released by the Ghana National Gas Company under the supervision of Dr. Emmanuel Godwin Ankudey.

In my life outside of research, I enjoy watching football with friends, biking, and listening to music.
