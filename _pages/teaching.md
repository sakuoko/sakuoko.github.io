## Teaching Assistant
Undergraduate course, University of Mines and Technology | Department of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering| 2024
Teaching Assistant for the Computer Programming undergraduate course, instructed by Prof. Suresh Purini. Responsible for preparing coding assigments and labs for 300 students and conducting tutorials and correcting papers for 30 students. 


## Research Mentor
Besides conducting independent research, I supervise self-driven students from the leading Bangladeshi universities: KUET, AIUB, IUT, and SUST. They are mostly in their 3rd and 4th years of their studies. I teach them how to do scientific research, how to write articles, what are the do's and don'ts of research ethics are, and how to follow the formats of different journals. I also help them acquire funding to support their research endeavors. I am proud to have supervised two talented high-school students in their research projects, both of whom earned merit scholarships to pursue a BS in the US universities.
