## Teaching Assistant
Undergraduate course, University of Mines and Technology | Department of Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering| 2024 <br>

Since graduating in 2023, I have been involved in academia as a teaching assistant and researcher in the Chemical and Petrochemical Engineering department at the University of Mines and Technology, Ghana. My teaching responsibilities include the following courses:

Courses in the first semester of the academic year
* CH 257 Organic Chemistry - For a combined class (Petroleum Geosciences and Engineering, Natural Gas Engineering & Petroleum Engineering students) size of 230, instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.
* CH 265 Engineering Materials - For a class size of 90 students (Chemical Engineering), instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.
* RP 375 Petrochemical Synthesis 1 - For a class size of 120 students (Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Engineering), instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.
* CH 271 Heat Transfer Processes - For a combined class size of 200 students (Chemical Engineering & Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Engineering), instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.

Courses in the second semester of the academic year
* CH 170 Fundamental of Chemical Engineering - For a class size of 168 students, instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.
* CH 276 Separation Processes - For a combined class size of 200 students (Chemical Engineering & Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Engineering), instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.
* RP 376 Petrochemical Synthesis 2 - For a class size of 120 students (Petroleum Refining and Petrochemical Engineering), instrucuted by Dr. Ato Fanyin-Martin.

These courses have allowed me to inspire the next generation of engineers while pursuing my research goals. My teaching style is based on my students' needs, and my diverse background allows me the sensitivity I need to relate to them. I believe I can contribute to my students' personal growth and motivate them to obtain their educational goals.


## Research Mentor
Besides conducting independent research, I supervise self-driven students from other universities. They are mostly in their 2nd, 3rd and 4th years of their studies. I teach them how to navigate the field of research and how to use today's available technologies to their field of studies. I also help them acquire funding to support their educational endeavors.
